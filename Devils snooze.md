# The Devil's snooze

## Page 1

### Panel 1

Close up on a digital alarm clock. It reads 3:32 AM. Out of focus is an array of clutter on the nightstand with it: a rusted spoon, a cleaver, a chicken leg bone, an Erlenmeyer flask half filled with green fluid, a thermometer, a butterfly pinned to a card, a deck of Tarot cards, a candle, and a toad. A skeletal hand reaches from somewhere beneath and behind the table toward the clock.

### Panel 2

Focus pulled back on the table. We can now see the Crypt Keeper, a gruesome zombie creature, loose flesh hanging on bones, sallow brown skin. With a cleaver, he chops off a human hand reaching for the alarm clock from some unseen figure in a bed off to the side.

Crypt Keeper:
> Don't touch that alarm clock, kiddos!

CK:
> it's almost 3:33, exactly halfway to... My house! Hahahaha!

CK:
> You never know who you invite to your bed when you return to sleep at the witching hour.

CK:
> You might spend nine minutes in Hell if you hit...

Title:
> The Devil’s Snooze

### Panel 3

The same clock, in the same position in the frame, but in a different environment. This one is on a nightstand surrounded by ordinary bric-a-brac, including a bottle of antacid tablets, reading glasses, a cellphone, an issue of Reader’s Digest so old the page corners are bending upward, a television remote, a drinking glass, a coaster that isn’t under the glass, a pen, paper clips, and loose change. The clock rolls over to 3:33. Jim's hand slaps at the alarm clock from out of frame.

### Panel 4

Pull back to show the king-sized bed next to the alarm clock. Jim is twisted up in the sheets, leaving none for his wife. She stands by the bedroom window in her translucent nightgown, looking out wistfully. She is gorgeous, and her sexy figure is silhouetted against the evening light. His hand waves in the direction of the alarm, but he’s not at risk of actually shutting it off. It’s dark outside.

Sound effect:
> Arrrg Arrrg Ar—

Jim:
> (sleepy) Just a few more minutes...

Gail:
> Jim, you'll be late. Your flight.

Jim:
> (sleepy) it'll be fine...

### Panel 5

A quiet little breakfast scene, although it is still dark outside the kitchen window. Gail, now dressed in a smart sun dress, is in the kitchen, frying bacon. A slovenly unshaven Jim slouches at the table, pushing toast into his face.
Gail: Should I pack you a witch?

Jim:
> Huh?

Gail:
> Should I pack you a sandwich? For your trip.

Jim:
> Oh. I'll just pick something up when I land. It's not a long flight.

### Panel 6

Jim is in his cream-colored Toyota Corolla. It has patches of rust by the wheel wells. His suit is shabby and rumpled. Gail, looking like a million bucks, leans close to the window. He's taking her for granted.

Gail:
> Have a great dying.

Jim:
> What's that?

Gail:
> I said 'Have a great time.' Are you feeling okay?

### Panel 7

She touches his forehead with the back of her hand. He squints, suspicious.

Jim:
> I could swear you--

Jim:
> Ah, whatever. See you in a few days.

Gail:
> Good luck, honey! I love you.

### Panel 8

Inside the cabin of the car, looking backward so you can see Jim's sneer and Gail receding in the distance through the rear window as he pulls away. He speaks normally, which Gail can't possibly hear.

Jim:
> Yeah, you too.

## Page 2

### Panel 1

Jim is in a long airport security line, shoeless, holding his pants by the waistband to keep them from falling. A uniformed TSA agent cranes her head from behind a monitor at the bag scanning station. There are a lot of people waiting, but there should also be several TSA uniforms among them.

Security:
> Is this your bag, sir?

Jim:
> Yes.

Security:
> If you'll step over here, sir. We have some extra security precautions.

Jim:
> What's the matter?

### Panel 2

Security gal spins the monitor, showing the x-ray view of his bag, which clearly shows a chef's knife silhouette.

Jim:
> That's not mine! I didn't pack that!

### Panel 3

Jim is on the airplane, packed into coach. The sun is streaming in through the little window. His face is flushed red. He is getting sweaty and rumpled. He is getting pressed on both sides by passengers who don’t quite fit into their berths.

Jim:
> (muttering) Three hours late... If missing my flight causes my checked bags to get lost, there's going to be hell to pay!

### Panel 4

View from the air steward section toward the passenger area. Jim’s red face can be seen squeezed in the sea of flesh. A stewardess is sitting belted into an access seat folded down from the wall.

Captain:
> We are about to begin our descent into Las Vegas, where the temperature on the ground is a toasty 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Be sure to stay hydrated, and consider staying inside your hotel until the sun goes down.

### Panel 5

Jim is outside the Las Vegas airport, pressed beneath the sweltering sun. He clutches his suitcase like it's a long, lost child. Another sits near his feet.

Jim:
> Thank Christ.

Baggage handler:
> Something like that.

## Page 3

### Panel 1

In a taxi. Jim is looking much more relaxed as he slouches in the back.

Cab driver:
> So, you here for a convention?

Jim:
> Yeah. I, uh, I sell alarm clocks.

### Panel 2

Cab driver half turns back to glance at Jim's face.

Cab driver:
> Can't be big business for clocks in Vegas. No one here wants to know what time it is.

Jim:
> When they see my clocks, they'll want to buy.

### Panel 3

Jim at hotel check-in desk.

Clerk:
> I'm sorry sir, I'm just not finding a reservation under that name...

### Panel 4

Jim at a different hotel check-in desk, much shabbier. The clerk is pulling out a second sign-in book in addition to the one on the counter.

Clerk:
> Overnight stay? Oh, well, we use a different guest register for those.

### Panel 5

Jim at blackjack table. Small stack of chips in front of him. Other nearby gamblers have notably bigger stacks.

Dealer:
> Blackjack. House wins.

## Page 4

### Panel 1

Jim in his hotel room, which is a shit hole. Tile floor, naked bed frame, cheap armchair with tufts of fuzz sprouting from holes in the side, floor lamp cracked and leaning, cheap scroll blinds on the windows half-closed. View from close to the ceiling, looking down on the scene. His 2 suitcases are open on the bed, each packed full of alarm clocks in a regular grid. Must be at least 30 of them in there. He is touching them possessively. No AC in the hotel — he’s stripped to his undershirt and shorts. Suit crumpled up in the corner.

### Panel 2

Same place, same view. Jim, still in just underwear, is sitting in the torn and stained chair. Buyer1 and Buyer 2 enter through the door. The sun casts a block on the middle of the floor.

### Panel 3

Jim half rises to meet his guests.

Buyer1:
> You look a little old to be a dealer, dude.

Jim:
> Yeah, well, you look just right for a junkie. Are you buying or not?

### Panel 4

Still in the hotel room, different view. It's a couple hours later now, and the sun rays have crept closer to the far wall. The suitcases open, a couple clocks gone now. Buyer3 and Buyer4 are in the room with him.

Buyer3:
> Hey buddy, you got the time?

Jim:
> Yer a laugh a minute, Groucho.

Jim:
> Each clock contains 4 grams of medical grade heroine. Cost is $1000. No negotiation.

### Panel 5

Buyer4 pulls a gun. Buyer3 shoves Jim toward the door.

Buyer3:
> How about we just take them all off your hands, grandpa.

### Panel 6:

Jim is banging on the door of his hotel room.

Jim:
> No, no no! You lousy motherfuckers! I’ll kill you!

### Panel 7

Jim at the front desk, shouting angrily at the uncaring desk clerk.

Jim:
> You have some kind of hotel security, right?! Get them the fuck down here. Those assholes are robbing me!

Clerk:
> I can call the police for you, sir. Would you like me to do that?

## Page 5

### Panel 1

Outdoor parking lot of the motel, same time of day. Jim lies in wait, crouching behind a car. He’s watching for those previous two buyers, who are coming out the side exit. Each carries a suitcase.

### Panel 2

Jim rushes at them with a tire iron. They are not professionals; Buyer3 has his arms raised to protect his face; Buyer4 has stumbled backward and is fumbling at the back of his waistband for his gun. Both suitcases have fallen.

### Panel 3

Jim swings on Buyer3, who goes down, arm broken. Buyer4 has got his gun out but pointed wide.

Jim:
> I am having the worst God damned day, and I’ll be fucked! Fucked! Before I let two dipshit thieves rob me!

### Panel 4

Buyer4 takes a shot, which creases Jim’s cheek.

Jim:
> Fuck!

### Panel 5

Jim flings the tire iron backhand, which clocks Buyer4 square in the face.

Buyer3:
> What the fuck? You maniac!

### Panel 6

In a little inset panel, we see Buyer4's hand dropping the gun. In the main panel, Buyer4 has turned and is running, dragging one of the suitcases with him.

### Panel 7

Jim picks up the gun. He menaces over Buyer3, still on the ground at the front of the frame.

Buyer3:
> You’re dead! You hear that? Dead!

Jim:
> Your buddy took off. If I were betting on which of us would die first, it'd be you.

## Page 6

### Panel 1

Jim is still in his underwear, rolling with his suitcase up to the back of the downtown Las Vegas Events Center. Two security guards bracket the back entrance, one of whom is smoking.

Security1:
> You looking for the homeless shelter, my dude?

Security2:
> Man, this is the Strip. There ain’t no homeless shelter. Too many tourists.

### Panel 2

Jim looks desperate. He’s also dirty and smattered with blood.

Jim:
> I need to get in.

Security1:
> That definitely ain’t happening. Walk away, hobo man.

### Panel 3

Jim waves the gun in their faces.

Jim:
> I came to see Aerosmith, and I’m going to God-damned well see Aerosmith.

### Panel 4

The security guys ARE professionals. One has taken the gun off him, the other is bodily pressing Jim’s face into the concrete.

Security1:
> That ain’t how this works, smart guy.

Security2:
> There’s a YMCA a few blocks away, man. They might have been able to help.

Security2:
> You know, up until you pulled a gun on us.

Security2:
> Now you just fucked.

### Panel 5

Security2 has knelt to open the suitcase while Security1 has his knee wedged into Jim’s back. His face, the lips partially mashed into the concrete, is in the extreme foreground.

Security2:
> The fuck is this, man? You working real hard for a dude peddling clocks.

Jim:
> (muffled) it’s dot just clots—

### Panel 6

Security1 is now standing, and is helping Jim to his feet. Security2 has closed the suitcase.

Security2:
> Aw, dude! You a dealer? Why didn't you say so? For sure the band gonna want to see you.

Security1:
> No hard feelings, my dude.

### Panel 7

Security2 hands Jim back the suitcase.

Security2:
> Gonna have to keep the gun, though.

## Page 7

### Panels 1 - 4

String of panels over a single background image. Jim is dragging himself across the theater's green room. He stands up straighter the closer he gets to the right edge. If you can arrange it, design-wise, it would be fun if the suitcase trails a panel behind him. In the background, the band members (minus Steven Tyler) relax.

Panel 1: Tom Hamilton sits on a little couch, strumming a tune on his bass for a middle-aged lady fan.

Panel 2: Joe Kramer and a black T-shirted security guard are picking at the buffet table.

Panel 3: Brad Whitford is getting handsy with a couple younger fans.

Panel 4: Joe Perry is sitting in a chair, leaning way back and blowing out a cloud of smoke.

### Panel 5

View from over Jim’s shoulder as he approaches a door with a gold star and a placard that reads “Tyler”. His hand is poised to knock, but it’s shaking.

### Panel 6

Jim knocks.

Jim:
> Uh… Mr Tyler?

Tyler:
> (dialog from the other side of the door) Come.

### Panel 7

Door is partially open. Jim leans over the doorway, not quite ready to commit to entering. Steven Tyler has his back to us, facing a dressing table ringed with bright lights, casting him as a silhouette.

Jim:
> Mr Tyler?

Jim:
> Johnny Flavius said I should come see you.

## Page 8

### Panel 1

Tyler starts to turn toward Jim. He face is still lost in the silhouette, but one hand enters the light of the rest of the room. It is red and gnarly, with long nails. Demonic.

Tyler:
> You have... something for me?

### Panel 2

Jim approaches Steven Tyler, dragging his suitcase. Tyler is haloed by the strong, white lights behind him. It’s so strong, Jim raises his free hand before his eyes to reduce the glare.

Jim:
> It was... it was so hard. You have no idea what I went through... getting here.

### Panel 3

Big close up on Steven Tyler, now properly lit. He is more angular than we expect, eyes featureless and dark but for reflections, brows arched. He is not the top-selling hard rock singer in American history; he is a demon, part of Hell living on Earth.

Tyler:
> Yes? Would you say you had a Devil of a time?

### Panel 4

The rest of band members fan out behind Tyler. They have all taken on demonic visages as well.

Jim:
> No! No!

## Page 9

### Panel 1

Jim disappears beneath a pile of demonic flesh. A spray of blood arcs onto the wall.

Jim:
> Argggh!

### Panel 2

Back in Jim’s bedroom, closeup on the alarm clock which now reads 3:42. It was all just a dream. The alarm makes its ‘Arg-Arg-Arg’ sound effect, picking up from the dream.

### Panel 3

Jim sits up in bed, clutching his chest with a fist still balled up in sheets. Gail is up already, by the window like in the beginning, wearing her slinky nightgown.

Gail:
> Are you okay, honey?

Jim:
> (panting) Dream. Just a dream.

Gail:
> What’s that?

### Panel 4

Jim sits on the edge of the bed with his legs dangling over. His head is raised to look out the window.

Jim:
> Nothing. Everything’s fine. It’ll all be fine.

Gail:
> Of course it will, dear.

### Panel 5

View from behind Gail to see the relief on Jim’s face. She holds a kitchen knife hidden behind her back.

Gail:
> You’d better start packing, dear. You have an important flight today.

### Panel 6

Crypt Keeper wrap up

Crypt Keeper:
> Remember kiddos, early to bed, early to rise makes a man food for the flies!

Crypt Keeper:
> Hahahahaha!
