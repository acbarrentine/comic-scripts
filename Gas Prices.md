# Gas prices

## Panel 1

A man and a woman in modern sedan. The woman is driving. Through the windshield we can see a Shell gas station. The sign at the corner gives the prices, $2.699 for regular, $3.199 for mid-grade, and $3.699 for premium.

Man:
> "I'm always hearing about how gas prices around the world are so much higher than they are in the States. Why do you suppose that is?"

Woman:
> "Production maybe? Countries that produce oil have cheaper gas?"

## Panel 2

Man is at his desk, working at his laptop. Mainly he's working in a spreadsheet. But there is also a web browser open with a map of the world color coded with gas price distribution. He has a chat open with his wife. They're continuing the discussion.

Man:
> "I don't think it's just production."

Man:
> "Look at Venezuela, there. Yes, they're an oil producing nation, but their neighbors are clearly not benefiting."

Man:
> "In Brazil, it's nearly $4 a gallon, while in Venezuela it's $0.01"

Woman:
> "One cent? That can't be right."

Man:
> "Apparently it's come down sharply. It used to be 2 cents."

## Panel 3

That same couple is preparing dinner. The man is chopping vegetables for a salad, while the woman rolls a stuffed pork loin. Their house is well-appointed and spacious, modern. No sign of any kids.

Woman:
> "You can't get water for a penny. There's got to be some kind of government subsidy operating there."

Man:
> "Here too, you think? It's not that cheap here, but some of those countries, like in Europe, were up around $6 a gallon."

## Panel 4

Our one-track heroes have separated again. This time, we're with the woman who is texting with her husband while cooling down from a rowing session at the gym.

Woman:
> "I think we do. I'm seeing a report from the IMF that we spend more on subsidizing oil than we do on defense."

Man:
> "The Impossible Mission Force?"

Man:
> "If Ethan Hunt is involved, you know it's serious!"

## Panel 5

The couple is climbing into bed. Matching pajamas!

Man:
> "Why do you think they felt the need to do that? Oil companies are among the most profitable in human history."

## Panel 6

Sundown on the gas station price sign. A little on the nose!

Caption:
> "The best government money can buy."
