# Christine

## Panel 1

Auto mechanic leans over the exposed engine block of a classic, cherry-red 1958 Plymouth Fury (Christine). His fingers are curled around a fuel line linked to the distributor cap. It has horns. A young man nearby looks on.

Mechanic:
> "Oh yeah. See the horns on the distributor? What you've got here is a demonic possession."

Young man:
> "Well, that certainly explains the murders. Can you fix it?"

## Panel 2

The mechanic hooks a thumb in behind the suspenders of his coveralls.

Mechanic:
> "Yeah, we got a Pope on staff. He's pretty busy these days, though. Might take a couple weeks 'afore he can get to your car."

Mechanic:
> "You should check wit' yer insurance company. May have a replacement covered if you got paranormal motorist coverage."

Young man:
> "I'm on my parents' insurance. Definitely not covered for paranormal."

## Panel 3

Side view of the scene, giving us a real glamor perspective on the car, with its tail fins and retro-future curvy shape. The open hood looms over the mechanic like the upper jaws of a crocodile. The young man has his hands behind his head, visibly stressed.

Young man:
> "I can't afford to be out of commission that long. Could you, like, sprinkle it with some holy water or something, get me through the week?"

Mechanic:
> "Let's see what we can do."

## Panel 4

Close in shot of the mechanic's left hand being yanked back as the car snaps its hood down in an attempt to bite it off.

## Panel 5

The mechanic pulls the young man out of range of the demon car.

Mechanic:
> "Yeah, I'm thinking it's too far gone, son. This thing's gone ambulatory. Take it out o' here, and yer liable to have bodies on your hands. You'd best leave it with us."
