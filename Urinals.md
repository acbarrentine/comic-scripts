# Urinals

## Panel 1

Interior of a public men's room. It's busy -- there's a line of men waiting for their chance at the urinals. I am in the line, but my head is turned perpendicular to the line, giving a profile view to the camera.

Caption:
> My hobby is making other men uncomfortable at urinals.

## Panel 2

I squeeze in behind another dude who has just finished up at the urinal.

Me:
> "Gross, dude! It's still warm! What the hell were you doing here?"

## Panel 3

I lean over a bit toward the guy to my right. Not enough to look over the divider, just enough so it's clear I'm addressing him.

Me:
> "What's your take on farting at urinals? Acceptable?"

## Panel 4

That guy is quarter turned toward me, trying to get peripheral perspective on me without risking eye contact.

Him:
> "What?"

Me:
> "We're in the bathroom already, right? Should be able to fart, but nobody ever does it. Why is that?"

## Panel 5

He's escaping from my field of influence. I am openly turned, calling to his back.

Me:
> "You ever wear sandals in the bathroom? The splash back is like a warm rain on your feet. Not recommended!"

Him:
> "Dude."

## Panel 6

I zip up and leave. I have a subtle smile. Job well done.
