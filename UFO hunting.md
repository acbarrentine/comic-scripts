# UFO hunting

## Panel 1

A pair of headlights from a boxy 1980s car parked on a small ridge overlooking a valley in a red-orange twilight. A few stars twinkle in the darkening sky.

Caption:
> I felt closest to my father when we went UFO hunting.

## Panel 2

A collage of all the paranormal ephemera my father believed in: Aztec-style pyramid, an older Edgar Cayce head, the Loch Ness Monster, the Jersey Devil, an Oak Island digging rig, an angel, the Egyptian god Anubis, a foo fighter, the fangs of vampire, and in the front, a pair of traditional alien grays.

Caption:
> He was so desperate to believe the world wasn't as mundane as it seemed, he would accept anything that hinted otherwise.

## Panel 3

Interior, office setting. My father, a short and boxy man, is screaming at his business partner from the wrong side of the other man's desk. His face is twisted in anger, while his partner looks more startled than anything else.

My father:
> Don't you touch a dime of my money, you Jew bastard!

Partner:
> Wow. So you're through here, of course. I need you out of the office by the end of day.

## Panel 4

Interior of one of our many childhood homes. It's fine, neither big or small. A little cluttered because we're all pretty sloppy. Principal furnishing is a big box of a television casting the only light in the room. My sister (10) and I (12) are vegging on the sofa. My father stands up in the way of the set, casting long shadows across us.

My father:
> "Come on. Let's go for a drive."

Caption:
> Anything to get away.

## Panel 5

We're back out on that ridge, laying back against the hood of the car. The headlights are off now, and the sun has finished going down. One of those old conic-headed flashlights is also on the hood, lighting up all three of us in silhouettes. The sky is full of stars on a gorgeous summer night in Virginia. My father is pointing at something in the sky.

Me:
> "I don't see it."

Caption:
> UFOs had the benefit of not being geographically restricted. You could find them ANYWHERE.

## Panel 6

Medium shot with my father and I framed against the broad night sky. We are edge-lit by the flashlight, casting our features in wonder.

My father:
> There were so many reports of mystery lights chasing our fighter planes in WWII, people assumed they were some Japanese spy technology. They called them "Foo fighters".

Caption:
> A little mystery that just might, if you were paying attention, make reality hurt a little less.
